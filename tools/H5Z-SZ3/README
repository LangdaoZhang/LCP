#H5Z-SZ3
#the filter for integrating SZ3 into HDF5

#Quick start

Step 1: Build & install SZ3 with '-DBUILD_H5Z_FILTER=true' to enable the H5Z-SZ3 filter

Step 2: Set HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH=$HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH:$<PATH_TO_YOUR_SZ3_INSTALL>/lib/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HDF5_HOME/lib:$<PATH_TO_YOUR_SZ3_INSTALL>/lib/

Now, you have finished the installation of H5Z-SZ3 filter.

Note:

The filter will use default compression settings if non-empty parameters (cd_values) are provided during filter registration.

If you want to change compression settings, one way is to provide empty parameters (0 for cd_nelmts and NULL for cd_values) during registration.
The filter will try to read configuration file with a name of 'sz3.config'. Compression settings can be adjusted in the configuration file.
